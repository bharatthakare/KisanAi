/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * allows public read access for market prices and weather records, and enforces
 * ownership for community posts and comments.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /community_posts/{communityPostId}: Stores community posts.
 * - /community_posts/{communityPostId}/comments/{communityCommentId}: Stores comments for community posts.
 * - /market_prices/{marketPriceId}: Stores market price data.
 * - /weather_records/{weatherRecordId}: Stores weather records.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Community Post and comments can only be created by authenticated user
 * - Market price and weather records are publicly readable.
 * - Denormalization is used to avoid `get()` calls and simplify security rules.
